 <h2>Brown Sugar Light </h2>
 <p>Making your own brown sugar is so simple and easy and it tastes exactly like store-bought! You'll never run out of brown sugar if you keep two simple ingredients on hand: white granulated sugar and molasses. The recipe ingredients are for light brown sugar. For dark brown sugar, see the cook's note. To keep it moist, put a slice of bread into the storage container. </p>
